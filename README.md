# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a dataset from Zomato, one of the most popular food delivery platforms. With an average of 17.5 million monthly transacting customers and a large, active base of restaurant partners, Zomato offers a data-rich environment to analyze customer preferences, restaurant types, ratings, and other insights. This analysis helps answer strategic questions and uncover trends that can drive business decisions.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to analyze the dataset and answer key questions, such as:
1. **Restaurant Type**: What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2. **Votes by Restaurant Type**: How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3. **Ratings Distribution**: What ratings do the majority of restaurants receive?
4. **Average Spending**: What is the average spending per order, particularly for couples?
5. **Mode of Ordering**: Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6. **Offline Orders by Restaurant Type**: Which type of restaurant has more offline orders, enabling Zomato to offer tailored promotions?

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized data on customer interactions with restaurants on Zomato's platform, including:
- **Customer orders**: Frequency, order types (online/offline), and spending data.
- **Restaurant data**: Types, ratings, and vote counts.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Loading the Zomato dataset into a structured format for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing data types, and removing outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore patterns and distributions.
4. **Visualizations**: Creating graphs and charts to highlight key insights.
5. **Insights and Conclusions**: Answering the project questions based on the findings.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **PowerBI**: Getting Insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code, visualizations, and notes.


## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the EDA and visualize the findings.
2. Explore the insights on restaurant types, customer preferences, and more.

## Results
Key findings from the analysis:
- **Popular Restaurant Types**: The majority of the restaurants falls into the dining category, Dining restaurants are preferred by large number of peoples.
- **Customer Voting Patterns**: Most of the ratings received by Dining restaurants
- **Rating Distributions**: Majority of ratings received by restaurants is between 3.5 to 4
- **Order Mode and Spending Patterns**: Majority of the couples spends around â‚¹300 

## Conclusion
The analysis provided actionable insights that can guide Zomato in making data-driven decisions regarding restaurant offerings, customer engagement, and promotional strategies.
